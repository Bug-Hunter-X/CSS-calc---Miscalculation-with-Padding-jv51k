The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` on an element inside a container with padding can lead to unexpected results because `100%` is calculated relative to the *content area* of the parent, while the padding is added to the total size of the element. This leads to the subtracted `10px` being relative to the smaller content area, causing misalignment.
